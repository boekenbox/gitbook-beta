## Base limits

For a single opportunity bitRage trades on more than one trading pair, this means that you must adjust your base limits to at least the minimum trade size of all pairs involved.

Exchanges often have different limits for different base currencies. When you buy 0.001 BTC worth of an altcoin, it might be the case that the altcoin amount is still below the minimum trade size of a second pair involved in an opportunity.   
  
Setting the base limit too low can lead to an opportunity getting stuck on one of the stages involved.

## Min volume to sell

Always make sure to set `MVTS` to at least the exchange defined minimum trade size of the base currency of your pairs. This way owning smaller balances than that will be disregarded.

## Trading Fees

The trading fees option in the exchange setting is absolutely essential. 

Always make sure to set it at the appropriate fees level for your exchange account. If you set it too low, bitRage might consider some opportunities to be profitable even though they are not.
