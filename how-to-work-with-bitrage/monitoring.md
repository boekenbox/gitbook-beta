The profit summary shows cumulative profits per exchange and base currency. Profits listed here include profits from final trades that have yet to fill.

In the active pairs settings you can monitor in which stage your pairs are currently trading. The **P** and **V** icons indicate if the profitability and volume of a stage are good to continue trading.
