# Strategy configurator

A strategy in bitRage is a collection of settings that can be assigned to one or more trading pairs. These pairs will then trade according to the assigned settings.

On **Settings &gt; Strategies &gt; Strategy Configurator** you can modify the [strategy settings](../../trading-strategy-options/strategy-options.md).
