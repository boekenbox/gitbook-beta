To enter these, go to **Settings &gt; Trading &gt; Exchanges**.

          <br />This is the key you&apos;ve registered during an order, or have entered
          on the &quot;swap exchanges&quot; page. Each exchange has it&apos;s own
          master key.

</table>{% tabs %}
{% tab title="Description" %}
This sets the trading fees paid to the exchange. Gunbot uses this data to calculate the break-even point.

Does your exchange charge 0.25% fees per trade? Then set this to 0.25. When your exchange has different fees for different types of trades, set the average fees per trade.

Trading fees are reflected in the average bought price. Exchanges only calculate fees after the trade comes in, Gunbot needs to know about fees before the trade is sent to the exchange.
