# Update API keys

{% hint style="info" %}
It is recommended to stop the bot core before updating API keys.

To update your master key, you can simply choose a connected exchange and enter a new API key.

The key is then automatically licensed to be used in combination with your GUNTHY wallet. The new key can be used immediately and is entered as Masterkey in your exchange settings. 

The API secret is only used to update your exchange settings.

**In case you use the same key as trading key, make sure to update this in the settings for connected exchanges.**
