{% endhint %}

Make sure to give your bot a unique user name, this will only appear on the tournament leader board.

If you run multiple bot instances and want all of them to participate in a tournament, number your instance nicknames like this: TraderNickname1, TraderNickname2, TraderNickname3. They will automatically get aggregated to a single leaderboard entry.
