# TrailMe

TrailMe is a group of features that allows you to trail different types of trades to reach better entry or exit points. This page describes all available configuration options.

Trailing works just like it does for the TSSL strategy, the difference being the starting point of trailing.

Orders resulting from trailing are only placed when the main strategy criteria are met, and confirming indicators \(if any\) allow the order. All these conditions must occur in the same cycle.
