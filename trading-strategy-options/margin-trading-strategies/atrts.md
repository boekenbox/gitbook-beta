# ATRTS

This page describes how margin trading on Bitmex works with the ATRTS strategy. The triggers for trades are slightly different than in the same strategy for regular trading.



## How to work with this strategy

The expected behavior for margin trading with Gunbot is that it will open one position, either long or short, and close this position when the target is reached. When the stop is hit before profitably closing a trade, Gunbot will place a stop order at loss. After closing a position, Gunbot will again look to open a new long or short position. Gunbot will not add to existing open positions.

Please don't manually add to or reduce positions opened by Gunbot, unless you stop running Gunbot on this trading pair until you've closed this position.

### Long / Buy

A long position is opened when the ask price crosses over ATR long value from the previous round.

### Short / Sell

A short position is opened when the bid price crosses under ATR short value from the previous round.

### Close

A position is closed when the desired `ROE` is reached.

### Stop

A position is closed at loss when `STOP_LIMIT` is reached.
