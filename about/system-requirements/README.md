# License info & system specs

## Supported platforms

Gunbot runs from your own Windows, macOS, Linux or ARMv7 computer or server. You are free to run multiple instances across multiple platforms and devices.

## Recommended system specs

* **CPU**: 64-bit
* **RAM**: 2 GB
* **Disk space**: 10 GB free disk space
* **Network**: stable broadband network connection

## License system

Gunbot uses a blockchain based license validation system. It uses our own ERC-20 utility token called "GUNTHY". Using this system, you can [manage your own API keys](../../setup-and-general-settings/profile-settings/edit-license.md) and change them anytime, or even sell your license to a third party.

**Your** [**wallet address**](how-to-create-a-wallet.md)**, combined with an airdropped amount of tokens, is your Gunbot license key.**

{% hint style="warning" %}
**You are responsible for your own API keys and GUNTHY wallet.**

Please understand that we might not be able to help you if you lose all your registered API keys and \(access to\) your wallet address. Make sure to follow all the security advise when setting up a wallet and properly save and backup the API key\(s\) used for Gunbot.
{% endhint %}

## Token airdrops and requirements

After you've registered your wallet address, you'll receive an airdrop with the required amount of tokens for your license type. **Hold these tokens at all times to be sure your Gunbot can run.**

These are the required amounts for undiscounted license types:

* **Starter**: 400 GUNTHY
* **Standard**: 1000 GUNTHY
* **Pro**: 1500 GUNTHY
* **Ultimate**: 2500 GUNTHY

**Discounted license have reduced token requirements.**

Tokens are generally airdropped within 24 hours after registering the wallet address.



## FAQ

**Are there costs involved when I update my API key?**

No, when you manage your own API keys there are no costs for changing them.

**How often can I update my API key?**

You can update your API keys as often as you want.

**Can I run multiple Gunbot instances using the same GUNTHY wallet?**

Yes.

**I have more than one registered API key for the same exchange, what to do?**

If you have multiple registered API keys for the same exchange, each key needs to be registered to a different GUNTHY wallet. You must run multiple Gunbot instances to do so.

**Can I change my API key to another exchange?**

Yes, you can change to any supported exchange at any time.

**Is it mandatory to register a GUNTHY wallet for my API keys?**

Yes.

**Can't I just use any wallet address?**

Abuse will not be tolerated. Only use your own GUNTHY wallet address in Gunbot, not a wallet provided by an exchange. Using your own wallet address is the only way to receive and control the required amount of tokens.
