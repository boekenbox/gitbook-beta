# New in v13 / v14

Gunbot v13/v14 focuses on bugfixes and improving user experience. That's why this time there is no long list of new features, just a long list of improvements.

## **Upgrading**

[Download](../../setup-and-general-settings/installation/download.md) the update and unpack it to a new folder, copy the `config.js` and `gunbotgui.db` files from your previous v12 installation into the new folder to keep your settings.

* Empty your browser cache for your Gunbot GUI \(for example with ctrl-F5\).
* In case you used https for the GUI, also make sure to copy both the key and certificate files to the new folder.
* If you have pairs that are already in DU or RT, also copy the /json folder from v12 to v13.
* New strategy parameters for v13 will be automatically added through the GUI the first time you update a strategy. This happens on a per strategy basis.
* Make sure to set the new Admin ID for Telegram, for better privacy.
* When you use email alerts, make sure the [syntax of your alerts](../../setup-and-general-settings/preferences/tradingview-add-on.md#alert-message-contents) is correct.
* If you also want to migrate your settings for the Telegram bot, copy the `tgconfig.json` file to your new folder as well.

_Due to new libraries used, you cannot simply overwrite the executable for this release._

## New features / changes in v13

* **New exchanges:** Gunbot now supports trading on Idax and Cobinhood. Please note that Cobinhood only has an API key, not an API secret - use an IP restriction for your key for added security.
* **Restrict buying with `SMACROSS` :** you can now restrict `SMACROSS` to only place a single buy order, instead of buying on every cross up. Set `SINGLE_BUY` true to only allow a single buy order.
* **Improved privacy for Cryptosight:** restrict who is allowed to view and interact with your Telegram bot.  Use the `admin_id` setting to specify one or more user IDs that are allowed to use your Telegram bot.
* **Improved GUI template:** better optimized for mobile usage, different color schemes and support for setting a custom highlight color.
* **Changes to margin trading on Bitfinex \(TV add-on\):** all amounts should now be specified in quote. 
* **Different alert syntax for closing positions on Bitmex \(TV add-on\):** longs are now closed with CLOSELONG\_, shorts with CLOSESHORT\_ instead of CLOSE\_ for both.
* **New path for log files:** per pair log files are now saved in the /gunbot\_logs folder.

### Additional changes in patch release \(v14\):

* **Improved ROE calculation for Bitmex**: values now closely match the **leveraged ROE values on Bitmex** itself. If you're unsure what value to use in Gunbot, refer to the examples on the margin strategy pages for `ROE`.
* **TradingView alerts on Bitmex Testnet:** email alerts can now also be used on Testnet.
* **Close entire positions on Bitmex using alerts:** enable `TV_CLOSE_ALL` to close an entire position when a close alert arrives, instead of closing the amount specified in trading limit settings.
* **`SL_DISABLE_SELL` :** Disabled the sell side after a short position hit `STOP_LIMIT`.
* **Lending Rate \(Poloniex\):** Allow for entering a maximum lending rate for margin positions.

{% hint style="warning" %}
**Notice for Bitmex users**

Disable `STOP_LIMIT` by setting it's value to 9999, to prevent accidental triggers.

Because it now triggers on leveraged ROE value, it could be that a previous lower setting causes unwanted stops.
{% endhint %}
