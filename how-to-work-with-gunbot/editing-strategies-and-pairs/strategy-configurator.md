# Strategy configurator

A strategy in Gunbot is a collection of settings that can be assigned to one or more trading pairs. These pairs will then trade according to the assigned settings.

On **Settings &gt; Strategies &gt; Strategy Configurator** you can view and modify strategy presets, or create your own custom strategies.

{% hint style="info" %}
Make sure to read up on [Gunbot strategies](../../trading-strategy-options/about-gunbot-strategies/) before you start trading.

On the strategy pages you can find detailed explanations for each buy and sell method, as well as documentation for all available strategy parameters.

You can create an unlimited number of strategies.

## Editors for bitRage and Market Maker

If you're a bitRage or Market Maker user, you can use the strategy editor in a different layout to manage the strategies for these modules.

Just create a new strategy with both bitRage or Market Maker as buy and sell method, and the strategy editor opens in a different layout showing only the relevant settins in categories that make sense for bitRagen and Market Maker.
