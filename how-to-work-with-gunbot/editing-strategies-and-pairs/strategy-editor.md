# Strategy editor

A strategy in Gunbot is a collection of settings that can be assigned to one or more trading pairs. These pairs will then trade according to the assigned settings.

On **Strategies** you can view and modify strategy presets, or create your own custom strategies.

{% hint style="info" %}
Make sure to read up on [Gunbot strategies](../../trading-strategy-options/about-gunbot-strategies/) before you start trading.

On the strategy pages you can find detailed explanations for each buy and sell method, as well as documentation for all available strategy parameters.
{% endhint %}

## Create a new strategy

Set a nickname for your strategy \(this can be anything you want, but don't use blank spaces in the nickname\), and select the main methods for buying and selling. Hit the **Create** button to save the new strategy.

You can create an unlimited number of strategies.

## Modify an existing strategy

Click on a strategy nickname to edit its settings.

## Duplicating and renaming strategies

When you duplicate a strategy a copy is created with a random tag at the end of the strategy name.

When you rename a strategy, strategy assignment for pairs does not get automatically updated. If you want to use a renamed strategy on existing pairs, make sure to assign the strategy to the pairs.

## Editors for bitRage and Market Maker

If you're a bitRage or Market Maker user, you can use the strategy editor in a different layout to manage the strategies for these modules.

Just create a new strategy with both bitRage or Market Maker as buy and sell method, and the strategy editor opens in a different layout showing only the relevant settings in categories that make sense for bitRage and Market Maker.
